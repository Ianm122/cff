Naivety as creative bliss

                   (the blush pink of nostalgia in real time)



Club Future Future's album, Dance Till Your Heart Breaks, is an earnest search for the forgotten intimacy in moments of teenage melodrama. The entire album could be the soundtrack to the first time you stayed up all night, your first party with an edge of danger, memories of shout-whispered conversations under the cover of a pop song blasted from the stereo. Both passionate and ethereal, the album is at once as introspective and energetic as the title suggests, swinging between ephemeral ballads and heart-pounding pop.

The opening track lingers on a naked voice, keeping the listener in the awkward space of listening to someone sing to you with no accompaniment, it's a beautifully vulnerable moment, a single frayed melody from which the album launches into epic anthems and atmospheric, dream pop that plumbs the depths of reminiscences through heart-on-sleeve lyrics buoyed by an Eno-esque production that serves up a surreal landscape of neon clouds and adolescent hide-a-ways.

The effect is that of the score to a montage of summer nights imbued with first romances, the kind we couldn't know would flare and fade so quickly. You can almost see these kids running with the warm night air on their skin.

Cascades of synths that dominate the sonic template here are delightfully cinematic, and provide a space for guitar lick tendrils to snake around soaring saxophone melodies evocative of the E-Street Band that's wandered into the discotheque where a teenage Kate Bush is out with her girlfriends. Layers build until the songs climax, propelled by anthemic rhythms that evoke pumping fists and pounding hearts.

The vocals alternate between the loose vulnerability of raw first takes, and stylized studio wizardry, between rough whispers and auto-tuned gloss. Ad lib moments that pepper these songs might have been cut from a more conventional approach. It's a risky move that pays off in capturing the authenticity of a young voice: self conscious, fun and earnest all at once.

The narrator of these paeans to her youth is tearful, as if she's looking out over the fallout of teenage freedom and opulence. Our teenage lives leave us as adult refugees, looking back in perpetual fascination and regret. What we only brushed up against, we wish we'd snatched up, and yet what we swallowed whole usually went down as a beautiful disaster. All of it falls into the realm of what we can never get back but perpetually look for.
